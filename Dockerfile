# Download the latest Tomcat 6 and copy to /usr/local
# The following commands are chained to keep the image size as small as possible
# It does unfortunately make it less readable so i try to explain each step:
# 1. download/install tar
# 2. download latest tomcat 6 from trusted mirror
# 3. untar the tomcat6.tar.gz
# 4. delete the tomcat6.tar.gz
# 5 & 6. Remove unnecessary webapps that come with Tomcat
# 7. Move the tomcat6 folder to where we will run it from
# 8. ask yum to clean itself up
RUN yum -y install tar && \
